<p><strong>Hello! Welcome to page about Track Biking!</strong></p>

<a id="Introduction to Track Bikes" class="anchor" href="#Introduction to Track Bikes" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Introduction to Track Bikes:</h3>

<p>A track bicycle or track bike is a bicycle optimized for racing at a velodrome or outdoor track. Unlike road bicycles, the track bike is a fixed-gear bicycle. This mean the bike only has 1 gear and you control your speed by the legs. For example when you pedal forward the wheel goes forward and when you pedal backward the wheel goes backwards. That is why brakes are optional when riding a track bike. As you see in this image of my bike it only has 1 gear and the frame is designed for riding in a velodrome.

<a id="What is a Velodrome?" class="anchor" href="#What is a Velodrome?" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What is a Velodrome?</h3>
<p>A velodrome is an arena for track cycling. Modern velodromes feature steeply banked oval tracks, consisting of two 180-degree circular bends connected by two straights. The straights transition to the circular turn through a moderate easement curve. Bicycles for velodromes have no brakes. They employ a single fixed rear gear, or cog, that does not freewheel. This helps maximise speed, reduces weight, and avoids sudden braking while nevertheless allowing the rider to slow by pushing back against the pedals.</p>

<a id="Race Formats" class="anchor" href="#Race Formats" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Race Formats</h3>
<ul>
<li>The most straightforward is the <strong>"scratch race,"</strong> where riders compete over a specified distance and the order of finish determines the winners.</li>
<li><strong>Points</strong> races assign value to specific laps throughout a race, e.g. every tenth lap. Generally the leading rider and sometimes the second place rider will be awarded points. The structure and timing of points races varies greatly, but the winner is determined by the accumulation of points and not necessarily the rider crossing the line first at the end of the race.</li>
<li><strong>Elimination races</strong>, also known as "devil take the hindmost" or "miss and out" removes the last place rider from each lap (every second lap on shorter tracks) until only three to five riders remain. The final standings are then determined by a sprint over the last two laps.</li>
<li><strong>Madison races</strong> team up pairs of riders in a tag-team format. Riders "sling" their teammate forward to facilitate alternating sprints that keep the pace very high during typically long races. Since partners can trade as often as they like, this is a very busy race format, with half of the racers racing and half circulating around the track at any time.</li>
<li><strong>Keirin races</strong> involve pacing 6 to 9 riders with a motorcycle known as a Derny. The Derny gradually accelerates until the last lap and a half when it pulls off the track and a sprint for the finish determines the winner.</li>
<li><strong>Omnium competition</strong> assigns a point value to final standings of each race and riders accumulate points over the course of an event or series of events. This is not a specific race, but a competition that ties races and events together.</li>
</ul>
